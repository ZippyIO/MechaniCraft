Better Crafting & Smelting update!

Yes, this mod is the remake / update of Better Crafting & Smelting mod made by microjunk. 
I took over the mod since he had some other mods to keep alive, but he's still helping.
Most of the stuff was made by him, since the mod wasn't mine.
I fixed, and remade the whole Steam Furnace, added the Project Table, a remake from RedPower2, and 
I am planning to make lots of useful blocks and items in the future.

This repo will be updated as soon as I finish a block / item, i fix a bug, or I implement new features proper.
